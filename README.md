## [Project 1: Wikipedia scraping and exploratory Data Analysis of the highest-grossing films](https://github.com/NathanParr/movie-grossing-data-analysis/blob/main/wikiscraper.ipynb)

In this project, I used pandas to scrape, clean and analyse the first list from the following wikipedia page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_films.

This is my first project working on a Jupyter notebook, as well as working with modules such as pandas, matplotlib and seaborn.
